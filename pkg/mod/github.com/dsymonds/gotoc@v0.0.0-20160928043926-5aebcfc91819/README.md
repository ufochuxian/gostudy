gotoc
=====
This is gotoc, a protocol buffer compiler written in Go.

This is **only** the parser side; you will need a plugin to generate code.

Quick Start
-----------
```shell
go get github.com/dsymonds/gotoc
go get github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
gotoc foo.proto
```

To enable [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) output, use the `-params` flag:
```shell
gotoc -params plugins=grpc foo.proto
```
